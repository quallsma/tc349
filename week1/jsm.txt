	At first look, the website seemed to be someones personal web account, however, at further evaluation, the purpose of the website became more confusing. Whether the website was personal, professional or even educational, the purpose was not clear at first glance. The picture make it seems to be personal, the articles section looks educational, and his portfolio makes it professional, however he could have transfer the portfolio to the current website before he published it.
	The design of the website was neat, personally, red and white are two of my favorite colors to use when designing, just like I use in my personal website.
