Not really sure about the purpose of the website, I can pretty much compare it to YouTube, however it is more user based. The design of the website those catches the attention of the people visiting or using the website, and it's a bit colorful so you know it's not a business type website. You could tell it's a social media type website specifically for videos.

Personally, I would not use the website because I'm not that into video blogs or anything that compare, how ever I would recommend it because it is useful at times.
