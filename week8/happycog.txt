For a web designing company, their website is sort of average. It could have use some more content to and could have showed some examples of some more of the work they did with some of the clients they have, instead of the four of the top of the web. Or they could have a list showing their clients. 

Overall I like the color scheme of the website, along with the fact the menu stays in one place even when you scroll down. The Home button in the middle instead of to the left is unique, however it could have use some more content on what's the company about, or give some history about the company.
