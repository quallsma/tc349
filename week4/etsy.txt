	I've been hearing so much about Etsy, but I really don't know what it's about. From what I do know it's a place where vendors could sell their own products, both handmade and vintage. This is actually the first I've heard if a website like this, and it seems like it could actually pay off.
	
	The website has a nice, vintage feel to it, which fits the purpose of the company. And it also looks like it is independently own and operated by a single person. It doesn't have over the top, fancy design as if a group of people had work on it, so it's more personal.
