At first glance, the website looked as if it was a merchant website selling shirts, however, as you went further into the site, it's more of a social networking site meant to connect people with employers specifically in the web designing field. The website has too much content however it is organized. It's main goal is confusing, but it looks like selling the shirts is the main priority.

The designing of the website is unique and in a way, not that much different from other merchant websites that are out there. For the job searching, I wouldn't believe that any professional website would actually look for employees through the site.
