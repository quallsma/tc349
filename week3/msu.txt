	Overall, the michigan state university website truly shows it colors with the green and white with the occasional grey. For a school main website, it shows the necessary amount of information needed to get its point across. The middle image display gets most of the focus, and just below it, the event reminder, basically keeps me up to date about the school.
	
	The design of the website is modern, but somewhat outdated, especially since the main goal is to attract more students to come to the school. From the time that I'd applied for school until now, it has changed, but not significantly. And I think they could use a testimony tab on the main website so students that's still thinking about schools have a little influence by this page.
