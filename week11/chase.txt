The website I've chosen is chase banking mobile website. The reason I chose this because I use this the most. The mobile site is more simple and reliable than the original site. There is less content so it is less confusing and it's more direct, log in is just on the first page.

Without the use of any pictures or animations on the mobile site, it loads a lot faster than the regular on a desktop or laptop. It's plain, simple, and professional.
