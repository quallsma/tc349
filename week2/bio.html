	<h2>Professional Bio</h2>
	<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Marsalis Qualls is a college senior studying Media and Information at Michigan State University, specializing in Interactive and Social Media. Before starting this major, he first started school majoring in Computer Science, which he has no longer interest after two years. This coming May, he will be graduating with a Bachelor's of Science from the university and is still currently looking for employment afterwards.</p> 
	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Marsalis was born and raised in Detroit, Michigan, where he attended Burton International for kindergarden until eighth grade, and later on went to Cass Technical High School where he studied Manufacturing Technology. At the age of 14, Marsalis had his first job at Detroit Golf Club, where he recently retired from going into his last year of college.</p> 
	<h2>Critique</h2>
	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At first sight at the website, I thought it was probably for little kids, with all the colorful graphics and the oversized text. After clicking on the icons, the site was a bit flashy, and the company is not particularly a design company, more technological than anything.</p>
	
	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the front page, they could had some more content, maybe a paragraph or two giving specific details on the company instead of just giving a short, one sentence description. And they could have added some more content on the separate pages for the software instead of just having a few words to describe a feature.</p>
