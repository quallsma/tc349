I have decided to go with TextMate and use Google Chrome to preview the html code. The reason why i chose TextMate is because of the side bar which lets me see all the files in the folder I'm working in, and at the same time switch in and out of the files with a click. I also like the color scheme when you programming, instead of the bright colors used in other text editors, TextMate uses darker toned colors so that they're easier to spot.
